his nephew henry jones , a london clerk . henry has , in the past , incurred debts that the squire had paid off , been sent away from oxford , and generally made a poor impression on his occasional visits to llanfeare . nevertheless , henry is told of his uncle s intention to make him the heir to the estate and is invited to pay a visit . isabel rejects her uncle s suggestion that she solve his dilemma by marrying henry , as she can not stand her cousin . indefer jones finds his nephew to be just as detestable as ever . as a result , he overcomes his prejudice and changes his will one final time , in isabel s favour . unfortunately , he dies before he can tell anyone . finding the document hidden in a book of sermons by accident , henry vacillates between keeping silent and revealing its location . he is neither good enough to give up the estate nor evil enough to burn the document , fearing disgrace , a long jail sentence and , not least , eternal damnation . instead , he comforts himself by reasoning that doing nothing can not be a crime . indefer jones had had his last will witnessed by two of his tenants , but since the will can not be found despite a thorough search of the house , henry inherits the estate . however , already extant suspicions are only strengthened by his guilty manner . he endures abuse from everyone ; his own servants either quit or treat him with disrespect . he takes to spending hours in the library , where the will is hidden . the local newspaper begins to publish accounts of the affair that are insulting and seemingly libelous to henry . it accuses him of destroying the will and usurping the estate from isabel , whom everybody knows and respects . the old squire s lawyer , mr apjohn , himself suspecting that henry knows more than he lets on , approaches the new squire about the articles , pressuring the unwilling young man into taking legal action against the editor . henry finds that this only makes things worse . the prospect of being cross examined in the witness box fills him with dread . he realises the truth would be dragged out of him in court . mr apjohn , by clever questioning , gets a good idea about where the will is . henry knows that time is running out , but once again procrastinates . mr apjohn and mr brodrick , isabel s father , visit henry at home and find the document , despite henry s ineffectual efforts to stop them . because he did not destroy the will , henry is permitted to return to his job in london with his reputation intact and \u00e2\u01424000 , the amount isabel was bequeathed in the other

admired for his grace and nobility of character . among jamie s friends is leandro , a lusty young man who is interested in the beautiful amaranta . she is the wife of the rapacious lawyer bartolus ; the attorney keeps his wife closely watched , and leandro has developed a scheme to seduce her . he masquerades as a wealthy law student come to take instruction from bartolus . the go - between in this is lopez , the local curate and the title character . don henrique , angered over jamie s status as his heir , makes a radical move to change the situation : he files a legal suit ( bartolus is his lawyer ) to have the boy ascanio declared his heir . henrique testifies that before he married violante , he was engaged or precontracted to ascanio s mother jacinta , and that the boy is his natural son . ( like other plays of the era , the spanish curate exploits the legal and ethical ambiguity of the precontract , which in some interpretations was like a demi - marriage ... but not quite . ) after the child s birth , henrique had second thoughts about the social gap between himself and jacinta , and got the precontract cancelled . jacinta can only affirm the basic truth of henrique s testimony ; and on that basis , henrique wins his suit . ascanio is now his legal heir , and jamie is out . violante , however , is outraged that henrique has exposed this shameful affair and effectively thrown her infertility in her face . she bullies her husband into reversing course and driving ascanio out of his house ; henrique offers the boy financial support , but the child returns to jacinta and his pretended father octavio . violante is not satisfied with this , however ; she reveals herself to be a truly ruthless person when she solicits jamie to murder both henrique and ascanio and so come into his family fortune immediately . leandro works his way into the trust of bartolus , and tries to seduce amaranta ; she is tempted by him , but stands on her virtue and fidelity . when bartolus finally becomes suspicious , amaranta can show that she and leandro have been in church , and not having a sexual assignation . the plot comes to a head in the final act : violante meets jamie and his pretended accomplices for the double murder \u2014 only to have her plot exposed . henrique is shocked into penitence by the exposure of his wife s murder plot \u2014 and reveals that he and violante are not actually , fully legally , married after all . bartolus too is cowed by his involvement in the matter , and vows to change his ways . jamie has no problem accepting ascanio as his nephew , now that their family relations are better ordered . massinger ends the play with a couplet extolling the middle way in marital relations , between too much pliability in a husband ( like henrique ) and too little ( like bartolus ) \u2014much like the concluding couplet in massinger", "answer1": "don jamie", "answer2": "jamie", "rouge_score": 17.147268810187395, "_id":

"tolstoy s experiences in the caucasus during the last stages of the caucasian war . tolstoy had a morally corrupt experience in his youth , engaging in numerous promiscuous partners , heavy drinking and gambling problems ; many argue tolstoy used his own past as inspiration for the protagonist olenin . disenchanted with his privileged life in russian society , nobleman dmitri olenin joins the army as a cadet , in the hopes of escaping the superficiality of his daily life . on a quest to find completeness , he naively hopes to find serenity among the simple people of the caucasus . in an attempt to immerse himself in the local culture , he befriends an old man . they drink wine , curse , and hunt pheasant and boar in the cossack tradition , and olenin even begins to dress in the manner of a cossack . he forgets himself and falls in love with the young maryanka , in spite of her fianc\u0103\u0161 lukashka . while spending life as a cossack , he learns lessons about his own inner life , moral philosophy , and the nature of reality . he also understands the intricacies of human psychology and nature.the young idealist dmitriy olenin leaves moscow , hoping to start a new life in the caucasus . in the stanitsa , he slowly becomes enamored by the surroundings and despises his previous existence . he befriends the old cossack eroshka , who goes hunting with him and finds him a good fellow because of his propensity to drinking . during this time , young cossack luka kills a chechen who is trying to come across the river towards the village to scout the cossacks and in this way gains much respect . olenin falls in love with the maid maryanka , who is to be we d to luka later in the story . he tries to stop this emotion and eventually convinces himself that he loves both luka and maryanka for their simplicity and decides that happiness can only come to a man who constantly gives to others with no thought of self - gratification . he first gives an extra horse to luka , who accepts the present yet does n't trust olenin on his motives . as time goes on , however , though he gains the respect of the local villagers , another russian named beletsky , who is still attached to the ways of moscow , comes and partially corrupts olenin s ideals and convinces him through his actions to attempt to win maryanka s love . olenin approaches her several times and luka hears about this from a cossack , and thus does not invite olenin to the betrothal party . olenin spends the night with eroshka but soon decides that he will not give up on the girl and attempts to win her heart again . he eventually , in a moment of passion , asks her to marry him , which she says she will answer soon . luka , however , is severely wounded when he and a group of cossacks go to confront a group of chechens who are trying to attack the village , including the brother of the man he killed earlier . though the chechens lose after the cossacks take a cart to block their bullets , the brother of the slain chechen manages to shoot luka in the belly when he is close by . as luka seems to be dying and is being cared for by village people , olenin approaches maryanka to ask her to marry him ; she angrily refuses . he realizes that his first impression of this woman s inaccessibility had been perfectly correct . he asks his company commander to leave and join the staff . he

woman grew so angry that she danced about , and zoza laughed at her . the old woman cursed her to marry only the prince of round - field , whom she could only wake by filling a pitcher with tears in three days . with some aid from fairies , who also give her gifts , zoza found the prince and the pitcher , and nearly filled the pitcher when she fell asleep . a moorish slave steals it , finishes filling it , and claims the prince . this frame story in itself is a fairy tale , combining motifs that will appear in other stories : the princess who can not laugh in the magic swan , golden goose , and the princess who never smiled ; the curse to marry only one hard - to - find person , in snow - white - fire - red and anthousa , xanthousa , chrisomalousa ; and the heroine falling asleep while trying to save the hero , and then losing him because of trickery in the sleeping prince and nourie hadig . the now - pregnant slave - queen demands ( at the impetus of zoza s fairy gifts ) that her husband tell her stories , or else she would crush the unborn child . the husband hires ten female storytellers to keep her amused ; disguised among them is zoza . each tells five stories , most of which are more suitable to courtly , rather than juvenile , audiences . the moorish woman s treachery is revealed in the final story ( related , suitably , by zoza ) , and she is buried , pregnant , up to her neck in the ground and left to die . zoza and the prince live happily ever after . many of these fairy tales are the oldest known variants in existence . the fairy tales are : the first day

waters of kush , their trade ship is attacked by the infamous reavers led by b\u00ealit , the queen of the black coast . b\u00ealit and her ebony - skinned warriors slaughter the crew of the argus , who are no match for the ferocious pirates . conan tries to rally the crew after the captain was killed , and when the fight becomes clearly hopeless he manages to jump aboard the pirate ship and sell his life dearly . conan kills many of the pirates , fully expecting to be overwhelmed and killed - whereupon b\u00ealit suddenly orders her crew to step back and spare conan , being impressed with the cimmerian s courage and ferocity ( and being sexually attracted to him , as she immediately and forthrightly declares ) . b\u00ealit offers conan the chance to sail with her , be her chosen mate , and help lead her fierce warriors . oddly smitten by this fiery woman , conan agrees and , for a time , they raid the black coast together brutally pillaging coastal towns and instilling fear into the superstitious natives . soon , the hyborian legends begin that the she - devil of the sea , b\u00ealit , has found a mate , conan , an iron man whose wrath is that of a wounded lion . survivors of butchered stygian ships curse the name of b\u00ealit and her cimmerian warrior with fierce blue eyes . sailing up a nameless river , b\u00ealit and conan encounter ancient ruins in which is found a lost treasure , a winged monstrosity and skulking hyenas that were once men . despite the bizarre murders of their crew and the various horrors lurking in the jungle , b\u00ealit and conan still find time for a thorough theological discussion , comparing conan s grim god crom with b\u00ealit s more ambiguous semite deities - all of which they discuss in between continuing their sexual romance which is alluded to by howard as having sadomasochistic undertones . in a moment of passion , b\u00ealit promises that even death could not keep her from conan s side , a promise which she must keep far sooner than she expects . despite her intense love for conan , b\u00ealit is soon captivated by a cursed jeweled necklace found among the lost treasure which seemingly instills the wearer with a mix of madness and monomania . in such a twisted mental state , b\u00ealit issues faulty orders . given the constant bizarre dangers and her own madness , her crew is soon decimated and b\u00ealit herself is hanged by the winged monster . driven to rage and now alone , conan confronts her supernatural murderer . he is on the verge of being slain when the spirit of b\u00ealit intervenes . conan slays the winged horror and leaves the ruins in b\u00ealit s ship with her corpse . the story closes with conan giving b\u00ealit a viking funeral - setting on fire the ship", "answer1": "belit asked

pair are married in march 1825 . they live a life of carefree happiness , but louise s jealousy embitters him and leads to his physical break - down . he dies in 1829 , leaving a grieving widow of twenty - four . ren\u00e9e de maucombe s attitude to love and life are in marked contrast to those of louise . when she leaves the convent at blois ren\u00e9e moves to provence , where she marries an

killing everyone aboard . stevens regains consciousness inside a dingy dim cockpit , leaking oil . communicating through a video screen , air force captain colleen goodwin ( vera farmiga ) verifies stevens ' identity , and insists he stay on mission to find the bomber before a large dirty bomb hits downtown chicago in six hours . inside the source code experimental device designed by scientist dr . rutledge ( jeffrey wright ) , he experiences the last eight minutes of another compatible person s life within an alternative timeline . stevens is unwillingly sent back into the source code repeatedly in frustrating , exhausting attempts to learn the bomber s identity . he tries to warn authorities on the train and flee with christina , escaping the explosion . other times he can not locate or disarm the bomb and dies on the train . but rutledge insists the alternate timeline is not real . it is revealed that he has been with them for two months since being reported killed in action in afghanistan . he is comatose and missing most of his body , hooked up to neural sensors . the cockpit capsule is in his imagination , his brain s way of making sense of a missing environment . a confused and frustrated stevens asks , as one soldier to another , am i dead ? angry to learn that he is on life support , he asks to be disconnected after the mission . rutledge agrees . stevens catches the bomber derek frost ( michael arden ) , who leaves his wallet behind to fake his own death , and gets off at the last stop before chicago . in one run - through , frost kills both fentress and christina , and flees in a rented white van . stevens remembers the license number and direction and the authorities use this information to catch the terrorist , preventing him from detonating the dirty bomb . the mission finished , rutledge reneges on his promise , ordering goodwin to wipe stevens ' memory for a future mission . stevens convinces goodwin to allow one more try , to save everyone on the train , despite rutledge s insistence that everyone on the train had already been killed in the explosion . stevens is sent back into the source code where he disarms the bomb , subdues frost and handcuffs him to a handrail inside the train . he reports the bomber to authorities , sends an email to captain goodwin , then calls to reconcile with his estranged father under the guise of a fellow soldier . he asks christina what she would do if she knew that she only had seconds left to live , and starts to kiss her . at the same time , goodwin approaches the air - tight chamber that contains the torso of stevens ' comatose mutilated body , disconnects the life support , and stevens dies . rutledge bangs on the outer door in vain . the scene cuts to stevens finishing the kiss with christina inside the source code , revealing that the alternate timeline of the source code has become real , contrary to what was proposed by rutledge . they continue on the train , and then walk through downtown chicago to the cloud gate , a sculpture whose image stevens saw during transitions out of the source code . this prompts stevens to ask christina do you believe in fate ? as they stand in front of the mirrored sculpture , stevens ' reflection in the cloud gate is seen to be the image of sean fentress . when the alternative - timeline goodwin arrives for work at nellis air force base that morning , she receives the email from stevens . while news breaks about the failed bomber on the chicago train , the email informs goodwin that they have changed history , and goodwin

family , who think bob may have some foibles , but is otherwise a balanced and sociable man . leo s children : anna ( kathryn erbe ) and sigmund ( charlie korsmo ) find that bob relates well to their problems , in contrast with their father s clinical approach , while bob begins to gain an enjoyment of life from his association with them . bob goes sailing with anna and helps sigmund to dive into

interview him about baby steps . the next morning , however , the television crew shows up early and , oblivious to leo s discomfort , suggest having bob on the show as well . leo is tense and makes a

have bob committed , but bob is soon released after telling the staff of the institution therapy jokes , easily demonstrating his sanity . forced to retrieve him , leo then abandons bob in the middle

number one fan and talks a lot about him and his novels . as a reward for saving him , paul gives annie his new manuscript which she saved from the wreckage . while feeding him , she is angered by the profanity in the new manuscript and spills soup on him but regains control and apologizes . she buys a copy of paul s most recently published book , misery s child , giving glowing praise to paul as she progresses through the book . however , when annie discovers that misery dies at the end of the book she flies into a rage , almost smashing a table on paul s head . she reveals that she lied about calling his agent and the authorities ; nobody knows where he is . annie leaves and paul tries to escape from his room , but she has locked the door . the next morning , annie forces paul to burn his latest manuscript . when he is well enough to get out of bed , she insists he write a new novel entitled misery s return , in which he brings the character back to life . paul complies , believing annie might kill him otherwise . he also tells her he will use annie s name in the book in appreciation of her nursing him back to health . however , having found a way of escaping his room , he sneaks out when annie is away and begins stockpiling his painkillers . he tries poisoning annie during a candlelit dinner , but fails when she accidentally spills her drugged wine . during another venture out of his room , paul finds a scrapbook of newspaper clippings about annie s past . he discovers that she was suspected and tried for the deaths of several infants , but the trial crumbled due to lack of evidence . paul also learns that annie quoted lines he had written in his misery novels during her trial . annie later drugs paul and straps him to the bed . when he wakes , she tells him that she knows he has been out of his room and breaks his ankles with a sledgehammer to prevent him from trying to escape again . the local sheriff , buster ( richard farnsworth ) , is investigating paul s disappearance . when a shopkeeper informs the sheriff he has sold annie considerable quantities of typing paper , buster surmises paul must be at the wilkes farm . buster pays annie a visit , who permits the sheriff to inspect the residence . when buster finds paul drugged and hidden in the basement , annie fatally shoots buster and tells paul that they must die together . he agrees , on the condition that he must finish the novel in order to give misery back to the world . while she gets his chair , paul conceals a can of lighter fluid in his pocket . when the book is done , he reminds annie it is his practice to have a single cigarette and a glass of champagne after finishing a novel . when annie gives these things to paul , he tells her that this time , he will need a second glass , for her . as annie gets a second glass , paul soaks the manuscript in the lighter fluid . when annie returns with the glass he sets the manuscript on fire , giving him the chance

criminals . her mother is eventually transported to america , and moll flanders ( not her birth name , she emphasises , taking care not to reveal it ) is raised until adolescence by a goodly foster mother . thereafter she gets attached to a household as a servant where she is loved by both sons , the elder of whom convinces her to act like they were married in bed . unwilling to marry her , he persuades her to marry his younger brother . after five years of marriage , she then is widowed , leaves her children in the care of in - laws , and begins honing the skill of passing herself off as a fortuned widow to attract a man who will marry her and provide her with security . the first time she does this , her gentleman - tradesman spendthrift husband goes bankrupt and flees to the continent , leaving her on her own with his blessing to do the best she can to forget him . ( they had one child together , but he died . ) the second time , she makes a match that leads her to virginia with a kindly man who introduces her to his mother . after three children ( one dies ) , moll learns that her mother - in - law is actually her biological mother , which makes her husband her half - brother . she dissolves their marriage and after continuing to live with her brother for three years , travels back to england , leaving her two children behind , and goes to live in bath to seek a new husband . again she returns to her con skills and develops a relationship with a man in bath whose wife is elsewhere confined due to insanity . their relationship is at first platonic , but eventually develops into moll becoming something of a kept woman in hammersmith , london . they have three children ( one lives ) , but after a severe illness he repents , breaks off the arrangement , and commits to his wife . moll , now 42 , resorts to another beau , a banker callum murray , who while still married to an adulterous wife ( a whore ) , proposes to moll after she entrusts him with her herd of cattle . while waiting for callum to divorce , moll pretends to have a great fortune to attract another wealthy husband samuel . she becomes involved with some roman catholics in lancashire that try to convert her , and she marries one of them , a supposedly rich man bretton . she soon realises he expected to receive a great herd of cattle which she denies having , leading him to admit that he has cheated her into marriage , having himself lied about having money that he does not possess . he is in fact a ruined gentleman and discharges her from the marriage , telling her nevertheless that she should inherit any money he might ever get ( finally , she mentions his name ) . although now pregnant again , moll lets the banker believe she is available , hoping he returns . she gives birth and the midwife gives a tripartite scale of the costs of bearing a child , with one value level per social class . moll s son is born when the banker s wife commits suicide following their divorce , and moll leaves her newborn in the care of a countrywoman in exchange for the sum of \u00e2\u01425 a year . moll marries the banker now , but realises what an abominable creature i am ! and how this innocent gentleman is going to be abused by me ! they live in happiness for five years before he becomes bankrupt and dies of despair , the fate of their two children left unstated . truly desperate now , moll begins a career of artful thievery , which , by employing her wits , beauty , charm , and femininity , as well as hard - heartedness and wickedness , brings her the financial security she has always sought . she assumes the name moll flanders and is known thereby . she is helped throughout her career as a thief by her governess , who also acts as receiver . during this time she briefly becomes the mistress of a man she robbed , and is finally caught by two maids

pedophile , the other was a company insider who cashed out his stock options before the share price collapsed ) , giving each a chance to reveal the truth to those they wronged , but in both cases , neither agreed and were killed . to demonstrate the threat , the caller fires a suppressed sniper rifle at a toy robot sold by a nearby vendor ; the damage is unseen by anyone but stu , the caller , and the vendor . the caller demands that stu confess his feelings for pam to both kelly and pam to avoid being killed . the caller contacts pam , and puts her on line with stu , who reveals that he is married . the caller then hangs up , telling stu to call kelly himself . as stu hesitates , the booth is approached by three prostitutes demanding to use the phone . stu refuses to leave , having been warned by the caller to stay in the booth and not reveal the situation . leon ( john enos iii ) , the prostitutes ' pimp , joins his charges , smashes the side of the booth , grabs at stu in a headlock and starts punching him . the caller offers to make him stop and asks if stu can hear him , which stu just answers positively , causing the caller to misunderstand stu and shoot leon . leon staggers away before collapsing dead in the street . the prostitutes immediately blame stu , making a scene over leon s body , accusing him of having a gun as the police and news crews converge on the location . police captain ed ramey ( forest whitaker ) , already suspecting stu of being the killer , seals off the streets with police roadblocks and starts trying to negotiate to get him to leave the booth , but stu refuses , telling the caller that there is no way they can incriminate him ; the caller proves him wrong , calling his attention to a handgun that was planted in the roof of the phone booth . both kelly and pam soon arrive on the scene . the caller demands that stu tell kelly the truth , which he does . the caller then orders stu to choose between kelly and pam , and the woman he does not choose will be killed . while on the phone with the caller , stu secretly uses his cell phone to call kelly , allowing her to overhear his conversation with the caller . she , in turn , quietly informs captain ramey of this . meanwhile , stu continues to confess to everyone that his whole life is a lie , to make himself look more important than he really is or even feels . stu s confession provides sufficient distraction to allow the police to trace the payphone call to a nearby building , and ramey uses coded messages to inform stu of this . stu warns the caller that the police are on the way , and the caller replies that if he is caught , then he will kill kelly . panicked , stu grabs the handgun and leaves the booth , screaming for the sniper to kill him instead of kelly . the police fire upon stu , while a smaller force breaks into the room that the caller was tracked to , only to find the gun and a man s corpse . stu regains consciousness to find the police
