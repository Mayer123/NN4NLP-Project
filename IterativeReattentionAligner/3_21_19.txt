Sample output 4 541 a humanoid alien who comes to earth seeking to construct a spaceship to ferry others from his home planet , anthea , to earth . anthea is experiencing a terrible drought after many nuclear wars , and the population has dwindled to less than 300 . their own starships are unusable for lack of fuel and 500 years of neglect . the antheans have no water , an abundance of food that is slowly dwindling , and feeble solar power . like all antheans , newton is super - intelligent , but he has been selected for this mission because he has the physical strength necessary to function in earth s hotter climate and higher gravity . arriving at earth in a lifeboat , newton first lands in the state of kentucky . he quickly becomes familiar with the environment and forms a plan . using advanced technology from his home planet , newton patents many inventions , and amasses incredible wealth as the head of a technology - based conglomerate . he plans to use this wealth to construct space vehicles for the rest of the anthean population . along the way he meets betty jo , who falls in love with him . he does not return these feelings , but takes her and his curious fuel - technician nathan bryce as his friends , while he runs his company in the shadows . betty jo introduces newton to many earth customs , such as church , fashion , and alcohol . however , his appetite for alcohol soon leads to problems , as he begins to experience intense emotions unfamiliar to antheans . eventually , newton s alien nature is discovered by nathan bryce , and it comes as a relief to newton to be able to reveal his secret to someone . he expresses the hope that the antheans he will ferry to earth will flourish and use their superior intelligence to help earth achieve peace , prosperity , and safety . however , the cia arrests newton , having followed him since his appearance on earth and having recorded this private conversation with bryce . they submit him to rigorous tests and analysis , resulting in conclusive evidence of his alien identity , but decide not to release the results for fear they would simply not be believed , and possibly even embarrass the government , which at this point is controlled by the democratic party . newton is released , but is immediately arrested by the fbi , which begins its own examinations . their final examination is an x - ray of newton s skull , through his eyes . newton , whose eyes are sensitive to x - rays , is unable to stop them and is blinded . the story of newton s blinding becomes a scandal which enables the republicans to take power , eventually leading to a catastrophe . newton , speaking to bryce for the last time , explains bitterly that he is unable to continue his spaceship project because of his blindness and because of planetary alignments which have changed during his captivity . he records a message which he hopes to broadcast via radio A1 anthea A2 anthea

( shipwreck on a deserted island , as a start for a new and better society , is a staple in the utopian genre â as in the spensonia books of thomas spence , among other possible examples . ) paul finds a deserted house built from wreckage ; it is a comfortable and neatly furnished cottage , and the two survivors move in . virginia is deeply distraught over their recent tragedy â but her state of mind improves when she realizes that the largest trunk in her luggage is on the cutter . the tinned meats and champagne also come in handy . two other survivors appear : an english clergyman who has been converted to positivism by paul , and an elderly woman . the latter soon dies , giving paul and the clergyman opportunity to debate the meaning of her death from the positivist viewpoint . paul keeps himself busy searching for the missing link . liberated from the trammels of traditional culture and belief , paul confidently expects instant attainment of the sublime happiness that is the natural state of free human beings . the clergyman proves to be an inconvenient convert , however ; he spends his time getting drunk and trying to kiss virginia , and paul s intellectual arguments have little influence on him . physical intimidation is more effective , since the clergyman is both a coward and a weakling . when the drunken clergyman falls off a cliff , paul meditates on the utilitarian aspects of his death . paul eventually converts virginia ; she gives up her religious faith , and replaces it with a sexual desire for paul â which the intellectual paul finds very uncomfortable . in her new commitment to glorious truth , virginia snoops through all of paul s private papers , and discovers his secret : he himself was once a clergyman . by the final chapter of the story , paul is reduced to baying at the moon . his howls attract the notice of another couple . the woman turns out to be paul s wife , who has come searching for her errant husband A1 she dies A2 fhe dies

Sample output 85 1130 francis walsingham ( geoffrey rush ) , to marry , for if she dies without an heir , the throne will pass to her cousin , mary , queen of scots ( samantha morton ) , who is catholic . therefore , the queen is presented with portraits of appropriate suitors , particularly the very youthful charles ii , archduke of austria ( christian brassington ) , who has become infatuated with the her . however , she refuses to marry any of them . english explorer walter raleigh ( clive owen ) is presented at elizabeth s court , having returned from the new world , and he offers her potatoes , tobacco , two native americans , and gold from a spanish ship that he claims was unable to continue its journey . elizabeth commands that the native americans be treated well and refuses to accept the gold . elizabeth is attracted to raleigh , enthralled by his tales of exploration , and asks bess throckmorton ( abbie cornish ) , her most favored lady - in - waiting , to observe him . bess also finds raleigh attractive and secretly begins an affair with him . elizabeth seeks guidance from her astrologer , dr . john dee ( david threlfall ) , who predicts that two empires will go to war . however , he can not predict which will triumph over the other , leaving elizabeth to ponder her and england s fate . jesuits in london conspire with philip to assassinate elizabeth and replace her with mary , in what philip calls the english enterprise , historically known as the babington plot . from her imprisonment , mary sends secret correspondence to the jesuits , who recruit anthony babington ( eddie redmayne ) to assassinate elizabeth . walsingham continues to warn elizabeth of spain s rising power and of the catholics ' plots against her . however she , unlike her predecessor and half - sister mary i of england , refuses to force her people to share her religious beliefs . even so , those conspiring against elizabeth are being hunted and murdered , including bess s cousin , sir francis throckmorton and his father , whom bess had failed to protect . after learning of her cousin s torture and death at walsingham s hands , bess turns to raleigh for comfort . walsingham s brother , a papist , who knows of the plot against elizabeth is jailed . walsingham reveals spain s plot to elizabeth , who angrily confronts the spanish diplomats . the spanish ambassador feigns ignorance , accuses elizabeth of receiving spanish gold from pirates , and insinuates that she has a sexual relationship with raleigh . in response , a sword fight nearly ensues between the queen s male escorts and the spanish contingent , and elizabeth throws the spaniards out of court . meanwhile , philip is cutting down the forests of spain to build the spanish armada , to invade england . mary writes letters condoning the plot . babington storms into a cathedral where elizabeth is praying and points a gun at her . elizabeth opens her arms , seemingly fearless . he pulls the trigger , and the gun fires . at first walsingham is unable to discern why the gun was harmless , though it is later revealed by the traitor , in the torture chamber , that there was no bullet in the gun . elizabeth learns of mary s involvement in the plot , and walsingham insists mary be executed to quell any possible revolt . elizabeth is reluctant , but nevertheless agrees . mary is tried for high treason and is beheaded , after ascending the block in a blood - red dress ( red being the catholic liturgical color for martyrs ) . walsingham sees that this was part of the jesuits ' plan all along . philip had never intended mary to become queen , but since the pope and other catholic leaders regarded mary as the true queen of england , philip uses mary s death to obtain papal approval for war . the murder of the last legitimate catholic in the line of succession gives philip the pretext he needs to invade england and place his daughter on the throne as a puppet monarch , and he oversees the departure of the armada from cรกdiz . in england , raleigh asks to leave for the new world , which elizabeth forbids , instead knighting him and making him captain of the royal guard . bess discovers she is pregnant with raleigh s child , and after telling him the news , she pleads with him to leave . he chooses not to , and the couple marries in secret . elizabeth confronts bess a few weeks later ; bess confesses that she is indeed pregnant with raleigh s child , and that raleigh is her husband . an enraged elizabeth berates bess , reminding her that she can not marry without royal consent . feeling betrayed , the queen banishes bess from court and has raleigh imprisoned for the crime of seducing a ward of the queen . walsingham arranges for his brother william to be released and taken to france , on the condition that he must never return to england . the armada begins its approach up the english channel , and elizabeth forgives bess and sets raleigh free to join sir francis drake in the battle . elizabeth gives her speech to the troops at tilbury , while seated on a war horse and wearing full plate armour . the ships of the armada vastly outnumber england s , but at the last moment , a major storm blows the armada toward the beaches , endangering its formation and ships . the ships of the armada drop anchor , and the armada becomes a sitting duck for english fire ships . elizabeth , back at her coastal headquarters , walks out to the cliffs and watches the spanish armada sink in flames . elizabeth visits walsingham on his deathbed and tells her old friend to rest . she then visits raleigh and bess and blesses their child . elizabeth A1 elizabeth .

( the audience shouted and cheered and clapped their hands . ) eventually , both tom and jim stop the fight , and tom walks liza home . liza is now publicly stigmatised as a wrong one , a fact she herself admits to tom ( oh , but i ave treated yer bad . i m a regular wrong un , i am ) . despite all her misbehaviour ( i could n't elp it ! [ ... ] i did love i m so ! ) , tom still wants to marry liza , but she tells him that it s too lite now because she thinks she is pregnant . tom says he would n't mind that , but she insists on refusing . meanwhile , at the blakestones ' , jim beats up his wife . other residents hear them and young polly appeals to some for help , but they choose not to interfere in other people s domestic problems ( she ll git over it ; an ' p'raps she deserves it , for all you know ) . when mrs kemp comes home and sees her daughter s injuries , all she does is offer her some alcohol ( whiskey or gin ) . that evening they both get drunk , despite liza s pregnancy . during the next night liza has a miscarriage . mr hodges , who lives upstairs , fetches a doctor from the nearby hospital , who soon says he can do nothing for her . while her daughter is dying , mrs kemp has a long talk with mrs hodges , a midwife and sick - nurse . liza s last visitor is jim , but liza is already in a coma . mrs kemp A1 harry .

Sample output 40 826 govinda , siddhartha fasts , becomes homeless , renounces all personal possessions , and intensely meditates , eventually seeking and personally speaking with gautama , the famous buddha , or enlightened one . afterward , both siddhartha and govinda acknowledge the elegance of the buddha s teachings . although govinda hastily joins the buddha s order , siddhartha does not follow , claiming that the buddha s philosophy , though supremely wise , does not account for the necessarily distinct experiences of each person . he argues that the individual seeks an absolutely unique and personal meaning that can not be presented to him by a teacher . he thus resolves to carry on his quest alone . siddhartha crosses a river , and the generous ferryman , whom siddhartha is unable to pay , merrily predicts that siddhartha will return to the river later to compensate him in some way . venturing onward toward city life , siddhartha discovers kamala , the most beautiful woman he has yet seen . kamala , a courtesan , notes siddhartha s handsome appearance and fast wit , telling him that he must become wealthy to win her affections so that she may teach him the art of love . although siddhartha despised materialistic pursuits as a shramana , he agrees now to kamala s suggestions . she directs him to the employ of kamaswami , a local businessman , and insists that he have kamaswami treat him as an equal rather than an underling . siddhartha easily succeeds , providing a voice of patience and tranquility , which siddhartha learned from his days as an ascetic , against kamaswami s fits of passion . thus siddhartha becomes a rich man and kamala s lover , though in his middle years he realizes that the luxurious lifestyle he has chosen is merely a game , empty of spiritual fulfillment . leaving the fast - paced bustle of the city , siddhartha returns to the river and thinks of killing himself . he is saved only by an internal experience of the holy word , om . the very next morning siddhartha briefly reconnects with govinda , who is passing through the area as a wandering buddhist . siddhartha decides to live out the rest of his life in the presence of the spiritually inspirational river . siddhartha thus reunites with the ferryman , named vasudeva , with whom he begins a humbler way of life . although vasudeva is a simple man , he understands and relates that the river has many voices and significant messages to divulge to any who might listen . some years later , kamala , now a buddhist convert , is travelling to see the buddha at his deathbed , accompanied reluctantly by her young son , when she is bitten by a venomous snake near siddhartha s river . siddhartha recognizes her and realizes that the boy is his own child . after kamala s death , siddhartha attempts to console and raise the furiously resistant boy , until one day the child flees altogether . although siddhartha is desperate to find his runaway son , vasudeva urges him to let the boy find his own path , much like siddhartha did himself in his youth . listening to the river with vasudeva , siddhartha realizes that time is an illusion and that all of his feelings and experiences , even those of suffering , are part of a great and ultimately jubilant fellowship of all things connected in the cyclical unity of nature . after siddhartha s moment of illumination , vasudeva claims that his work is done and he must depart into the woods , leaving siddhartha peacefully fulfilled and alone once more . toward the end of his life , govinda hears about an enlightened ferryman and travels to siddhartha , not initially recognizing him as his old childhood friend . govinda asks the now - elderly siddhartha to relate his wisdom and siddhartha replies that for every true statement there is an opposite one that is also true ; that language and the confines of time lead people to adhere to one fixed belief that does not account for the fullness of the truth . because nature works in a self - sustaining cycle , every entity carries in it the potential for its opposite and so the world must always be considered complete . siddhartha simply urges people to identify and love the world in its completeness . siddhartha then requests that govinda kiss his forehead and , when he does , govinda experiences the visions of timelessness that siddhartha himself saw with vasudeva by the river . govinda A1 govinda .

Sample output 2 995 new york city from the demi - god gozer , the ghostbustersâpeter venkman , egon spengler , ray stantz , and winston zeddemoreâwere sued by several city and state agencies for the property damage . rather than face financial ruin , they accepted a restraining order barring them from operating as paranormal investigators and eliminatorsâforcing them out of business . in the eyes of the city , they are now considered frauds . five years later , ray owns an occult bookstore and works as an unpopular children s entertainer with winston ; egon has returned to columbia university to conduct experiments into human emotion ; and peter hosts a pseudo - psychic television show . peter s former girlfriend dana barrett has had a son , oscar , with a violinist whom she married then divorced when he received an offer to join the london symphony orchestra . in order to take care of her baby , dana quit performing and now works as a restorer at the fictional manhattan museum of art , working to prepare a malevolent - looking portrait of a legendary sixteenth - century tyrant named vigo the carpathian of moldavia for an upcoming exhibition . after an incident in which oscar s baby carriage is controlled by an unseen force and drawn to a busy intersection , dana turns to the ghostbusters for help . meanwhile , dana s colleague dr . janosz poha has become increasingly obsessed with the glowering image of vigo in the painting and falls under its spell . vigo , whose spirit inhabits the painting , orders janosz to locate a child that he can possess , allowing him to return to life on the new year . janosz , infatuated with dana , offers to bring baby oscar to vigo in exchange for dana , a deal which vigo accepts . the ghostbusters ' investigation leads them to illegally excavate first avenue at the point where the baby carriage stopped . lowered underneath , ray discovers a vast river of pink slime filling an abandoned pneumatic transit line . attacked by the slime after obtaining a sample , ray causes a city - wide blackout by accidentally kicking a cast iron pipe that breaks , falls , and shorts out an electric cable . after this , the ghostbusters are arrested by the nypd . ineffectually defended by louis tully , they are found guilty of violating the restraining order by judge wexler , aka the hammer . before they are taken to riker s island , wexler angrily berates them . in response , the slime recovered by ray and taken as evidence explodes , releasing the ghosts of two murderers that the judge had condemned to death that proceed to devastate the courtroom . the ghostbusters capture the ghosts in return for the cancellation of the restraining order . later , the slime invades dana s apartment via the bathtub and attacks her and oscar . she seeks refuge with peter , and the two begin to renew their relationship . investigating the psychomagnatheric ' slime and vigo s history , the ghostbusters discover that it reacts to emotions ; it can be charged positively or negatively . they suspect that it has been generated by the negative attitudes of new yorkers . while peter and dana have dinner together , egon , ray , and winston explore the underground river of slime . while measuring its depth , winston gets pulled into the slime flow , and ray and egon jump in after him . after they escape back to the surface ray and winston begin an angry argument , but egon realizes that they are being influenced by the slime , so they strip off their clothes . they also learn the river is flowing underground directly to the museum where dana works . the ghostbusters go to the mayor with their suspicions , but are dismissed ; the mayor s assistant , jack hardemeyer , has them committed to a psychiatric hospital to protect the mayor s campaign for governor . meanwhile , a spirit resembling janosz as a nanny kidnaps oscar from peter s apartment , and dana pursues them to the museum alone . after she enters , the museum is covered with a cocoon of impenetrable slime . new year s eve sees a sudden increase of supernatural activity as the slime rises from the subway line and onto the city streets , causing widespread paranormal activity with ghosts attacking citizens . in response , the mayor fires hardemeyer and has the ghostbusters released . after heading to the museum , they are unable to breach the slime barrier with their proton packs . determining that they need a powerful symbol to rally the citizens and weaken the slime , the ghostbusters use positively charged mood slime and a remix of higher and higher to animate the statue of liberty and pilot it through the streets before the cheering crowds . as they arrive at the museum , the slime begins to recede and they use the statue s flaming torch to break through a skylight to attack vigo and janosz . janosz is neutralized with positively charged mood slime , but vigo immobilizes the ghostbusters and attempts to transfer into oscar s body . the positive feelings accompanying a chorus of auld lang syne by the citizens outside weakens vigo , returning him to the painting and freeing the ghostbusters . vigo momentarily possesses ray , and the other ghostbusters attack him with a combination of proton streams and positively charged mood slime . this destroys vigo and changes the painting to a likeness of the four ghostbusters standing protectively around oscar . outside , the ghostbusters receive a standing ovation from the crowd and , at a later ceremony to restore the statue , the key to the city from the mayor A1 new york city A2 new york city

Sample output 24 960 to keep his promises and the compulsive lying he engages in for his career often cause problems between them and with his former wife audrey ( tierney ) , who has become involved with another man named jerry ( elwes ) . in court , fletcher is willing to exaggerate the stories of his clients , and his current client , the self - centered , money - grabbing samantha cole ( tilly ) has garnered the attention of mr . allen , a partner at the law firm in which fletcher works . if fletcher wins this case , it will bring his firm a fortune and boost his career . fletcher calls and lies to audrey about missing max s birthday due to work , when he is actually having sex with his boss , miranda , in order to get a promotion . dejected , max makes a birthday wish that for one day his father can not tell a lie . the wish immediately comes true , and fletcher accidentally tells miranda he has had better after they have sex . the following day , fletcher immediately realizes that he is unable to do anything dishonest . he can not lie , mislead , or even deceive by withholding a true answer , often uncontrollably blurting out offensive and painful truths that anger his co - workers , and his car ends up in an impound for several parking violations . this comes to a head when he realizes that he is unable to even ask questions when he knows the answer will be a lie , which is inconvenient as samantha and her alleged affair partner kenneth faulk are willing to commit perjury to win the high profile case and he can not ask him the questions they have been given answers for . realizing that max had wished for this to happen , fletcher tries to convince him that adults need to lie , but can not give any type of answer at why he should continue to lie to his son . fletcher also figures out that since max wished for him to tell the truth for only one day , he tries to do what he can to delay samantha s case since the magic wish will expire at 8:15 p.m. , 24 hours after max made the wish . things only get worse for fletcher as he loses his loyal assistant greta after admitting he had lied about the miserly reasons for denying her pay raises and the expensive gifts he gave her , and audrey tells fletcher that she and max are moving to boston with jerry in order to prevent any more heartbreaks from fletcher s broken promises . fletcher s erratic behavior in court leads to several questions of his sanity as he objects to himself and badgers and provokes his own witnesses into admitting they had an affair against samantha and her husband s prenuptial agreement . he even goes so far as to beat himself up and claim that someone attacked him in order to try and avoid the case , but when asked if he feels like he can continue , he ca n't deny it and he says yes . during the case , fletcher finds a technicality that samantha lied that she was underage when she signed the prenup prior to her marriage , rendering it void and entitling her to half of mr . cole s estate , allowing him to win the case truthfully . but when samantha decides to contest full custody of their children , who mr . cole dearly loves , just because she wants more money from the child support payments , fletcher regrets mentioning the technicality after seeing mrs . cole pull the children out of their father s arms , and shriek her demands for more money . realizing now that winning the case has punished the loving husband and rewarded the cheating wife , fletcher has a crisis of conscience and shouts at the judge demanding that he reverse the decision , but he is arrested for contempt of court . he calls audrey from the prison s phone and pleads with her to bail him out and give him another chance , but she hangs up on him . greta returns and bails fletcher from jail , who forgives him and realizes that telling the truth has made him a better man and he rushes to the airport to stop audrey and max from leaving forever . he misses their flight , but he sneaks onto the tarmac by hiding in a piece of luggage , steals a motorized staircase , and manages to gain the pilot s attention by throwing his shoe at the cockpit window , forcing him to abort the flight . however , fletcher s victory is cut short when he crashes into a barrier and is sent flying into a baggage tug , which causes a chain reaction that leaves fletcher unconscious and with both of his legs broken . after waking up , he tells max how much he cares about him and how sorry he was for breaking his promises . despite no longer being under the wish s influence , fletcher means what he says and adds that max is his priority , and max convinces audrey to stay in los angeles . one year later , fletcher is healed and is running his own law firm with greta as his continued assistant . max makes a wish with his birthday cake A1 flecher reede told max that adults needs to lie .

Sample output 7 907 lawyer fletcher reede ( carrey ) loves his son max ( cooper ) , but his inability to keep his promises and the compulsive lying he engages in for his career often cause problems between them and with his former wife audrey ( tierney ) , who has become involved with another man named jerry ( elwes ) . in court , fletcher is willing to exaggerate the stories of his clients , and his current client , the self - centered , money - grabbing samantha cole ( tilly ) has garnered the attention of mr . allen , a partner at the law firm in which fletcher works . if fletcher wins this case , it will bring his firm a fortune and boost his career . fletcher calls and lies to audrey about missing max s birthday due to work , when he is actually having sex with his boss , miranda , in order to get a promotion . dejected , max makes a birthday wish that for one day his father can not tell a lie . the wish immediately comes true , and fletcher accidentally tells miranda he has had better after they have sex . the following day , fletcher immediately realizes that he is unable to do anything dishonest . he can not lie , mislead , or even deceive by withholding a true answer , often uncontrollably blurting out offensive and painful truths that anger his co - workers , and his car ends up in an impound for several parking violations . this comes to a head when he realizes that he is unable to even ask questions when he knows the answer will be a lie , which is inconvenient as samantha and her alleged affair partner kenneth faulk are willing to commit perjury to win the high profile case and he can not ask him the questions they have been given answers for . realizing that max had wished for this to happen , fletcher tries to convince him that adults need to lie , but can not give any type of answer at why he should continue to lie to his son . fletcher also figures out that since max wished for him to tell the truth for only one day , he tries to do what he can to delay samantha s case since the magic wish will expire at 8:15 p.m. , 24 hours after max made the wish . things only get worse for fletcher as he loses his loyal assistant greta after admitting he had lied about the miserly reasons for denying her pay raises and the expensive gifts he gave her , and audrey tells fletcher that she and max are moving to boston with jerry in order to prevent any more heartbreaks from fletcher s broken promises . fletcher s erratic behavior in court leads to several questions of his sanity as he objects to himself and badgers and provokes his own witnesses into admitting they had an affair against samantha and her husband s prenuptial agreement . he even goes so far as to beat himself up and claim that someone attacked him in order to try and avoid the case , but when asked if he feels like he can continue , he ca n't deny it and he says yes . during the case , fletcher finds a technicality that samantha lied that she was underage when she signed the prenup prior to her marriage , rendering it void and entitling her to half of mr . cole s estate , allowing him to win the case truthfully . but when samantha decides to contest full custody of their children , who mr . cole dearly loves , just because she wants more money from the child support payments , fletcher regrets mentioning the technicality after seeing mrs . cole pull the children out of their father s arms , and shriek her demands for more money . realizing now that winning the case has punished the loving husband and rewarded the cheating wife , fletcher has a crisis of conscience and shouts at the judge demanding that he reverse the decision , but he is arrested for contempt of court . he calls audrey from the prison s phone and pleads with her to bail him out and give him another chance , but she hangs up on him . greta returns and bails fletcher from jail , who forgives him and realizes that telling the truth has made him a better man and he rushes to the airport to stop audrey and max from leaving forever . he misses their flight , but he sneaks onto the tarmac by hiding in a piece of luggage , steals a motorized staircase , and manages to gain the pilot s attention by throwing his shoe at the cockpit window , forcing him to abort the flight . however , fletcher s victory is cut short when he crashes into a barrier and is sent flying into a baggage tug , which causes a chain reaction that leaves fletcher unconscious and with both of his legs broken . after waking up , he tells max how much he cares about him and how sorry he was for breaking his promises . despite no longer being under the wish s influence A1 his career .

Sample output 18 995 the death of its legendary leader , lorenzo de ' medici . in this setting , a florentine trader meets a shipwrecked stranger , who introduces himself as tito melema , a young italianate - greek scholar . tito becomes acquainted with several other florentines , including nello the barber and a young girl named tessa . he is also introduced to a blind scholar named bardo de ' bardi , and his daughter romola . as tito becomes settled in florence , assisting bardo with classical studies , he falls in love with romola . however , tessa falls in love with tito , and the two are married in a mock ceremony . tito learns from fra luca , a dominican monk , that his adoptive father has been forced into slavery and is asking for assistance . tito introspects , comparing filial duty to his new ambitions in florence , and decides that it would be futile to attempt to rescue his adoptive father . this paves the way for romola and tito to marry . fra luca shortly thereafter falls ill and before his death he speaks to his estranged sister , romola . ignorant of romola s plans , fra luca warns her of a vision foretelling a marriage between her and a mysterious stranger who will bring pain to her and her father . after fra luca s death , tito dismisses the warning and advises romola to trust him . tito and romola become betrothed at the end of carnival , to be married at easter after tito returns from a visit to rome . the novel then skips ahead to november 1494 , more than eighteen months after the marriage . in that time , the french - italian wars have seen florence enter uneasy times . girolamo savonarola preaches to florentines about ridding the church and the city of scourge and corruption , and drums up support for the new republican government . piero de ' medici , lorenzo de ' medici s son and successor to the lordship of florence , has been driven from the city for his ignominious surrender to the invading french king , charles viii . the medici palace is looted and the medici family formally exiled from the city . in this setting , tito , now a valued member of florentine society , participates in the reception for the french invaders . tito encounters an escaped prisoner , who turns out to be his adopted father , baldassarre . panicked and somewhat ashamed of his earlier inaction , tito denies knowing the escaped prisoner and calls him a madman . baldassarre escapes into the duomo , where he swears revenge on his unfilial adoptive son . growing ever more fearful , tito plans to leave florence . to do this , he betrays his late father - in - law , bardo , who died some months earlier , by selling the late scholar s library . this reveals to romola the true nature of her husband s character . she secretly leaves tito and florence , but is persuaded by savonarola to return to fulfil her obligations to her marriage and her fellow florentines . nevertheless , the love between romola and tito has gone . again the action of the novel moves forward , from christmas 1494 to october 1496 . in that time , florence has endured political upheaval , warfare and famine . religious fervour has swept through florence under the leadership of savonarola , culminating in the bonfire of the vanities . the league of venice has declared war on the french king and his italian ally , florence . starvation and disease run rampant through the city . romola , now a supporter of savonarola , helps the poor and sick where she can . meanwhile , tito is embroiled in a complex game of political manoeuvring and duplicitous allegiances in the new florentine government . mirroring this , he has escaped attempts by baldassarre to both kill and expose him , and maintains a secret marriage to tessa , with whom he has fathered two children . romola becomes defiant of tito , and the two manoeuvre to thwart each other s plans . romola meets an enfeebled baldassarre , who reveals tito s past and leads her to tessa . political turmoil erupts in florence . five supporters of the medici family are sentenced to death , including romola s godfather , bernardo del nero . she learns that tito has played a role in their arrest . romola pleads with savonarola to intervene , but he refuses . romola s faith in savonarola and florence is shaken , and once again she leaves the city . meanwhile , florence is under papal pressure to expel savonarola . his arrest is effected by rioters , who then turn their attention to several of the city s political elite . tito becomes a target of the rioters , but he escapes the mob by diving into the arno river . however , upon leaving the river , tito is killed by baldassarre . romola makes her way to the coast . emulating gostanza in boccaccio s the decameron ( v , 2 ) , she drifts out to sea in a small boat to die . however , the boat takes her to a small village affected by the plague , and she helps the survivors . romola s experience gives her a new purpose in life and she returns to florence . savonarola is tried for heresy and burned at the stake , but for romola his influence remains inspiring . romola takes care of tessa and her two children , with the help of her older cousin . the story ends with romola A1 lorenzo de ' medici A2 legendary leader lorenzo de medici

Sample output 77 642 an enemy of lady chiltern s from their school days , attempts to blackmail sir robert into supporting a fraudulent scheme to build a canal in argentina . apparently , mrs . cheveley s dead mentor and lover , baron arnheim , convinced the young sir robert to sell him a cabinet secret , a secret that suggested he buy stocks in the suez canal three days before the british government announced its purchase . sir robert made his fortune with that illicit money , and mrs . cheveley has the letter to prove his crime . fearing the ruin of both career and marriage , sir robert submits to her demands . when mrs . cheveley pointedly informs lady chiltern of sir robert s change of heart regarding the canal scheme , the morally inflexible lady chiltern , unaware of both her husband s past and the blackmail plot , insists that sir robert renege on his promise . for lady chiltern , their marriage is predicated on her having an ideal husband âthat is , a model spouse in both private and public life that she can worship : thus sir robert must remain unimpeachable in all his decisions . sir robert complies with the lady s wishes and apparently seals his doom . also toward the end of actâ i , mabel and lord goring come upon a diamond brooch that lord goring gave someone many years ago . goring takes the brooch and asks that mabel inform him if anyone comes to retrieve it . in the second act , which also takes place at sir robert s house , lord goring urges sir robert to fight mrs . cheveley and admit his guilt to his wife . he also reveals that he and mrs . cheveley were formerly engaged . after finishing his conversation with sir robert , goring engages in flirtatious banter with mabel . he also takes lady chiltern aside and obliquely urges her to be less morally inflexible and more forgiving . once goring leaves , mrs . cheveley appears , unexpected , in search of a brooch she lost the previous evening . incensed at sir robert s reneging on his promise , she ultimately exposes sir robert to his wife once they are both in the room . unable to accept a sir robert now unmasked , lady chiltern then denounces her husband and refuses to forgive him . in the third act , set in lord goring s home , goring receives a pink letter from lady chiltern asking for his help , a letter that might be read as a compromising love note . just as goring receives this note , however , his father , lord caversham , drops in and demands to know when his son will marry . a visit from sir robert , who seeks further counsel from goring , follows . meanwhile , mrs . cheveley arrives unexpectedly and , misrecognized by the butler as the woman goring awaits , is ushered into lord goring s drawing room . while she waits , she finds lady chiltern s letter . ultimately , sir robert discovers mrs . cheveley in the drawing room and , convinced of an affair between these two former lovers , angrily storms out of the house . when she and lord goring confront each other A1 she offers to give sir robert s letter in exchange to marry her old beau A2 that she ll give lord robert s letter to goring if he marries her

Sample output 178 1138 basil hallward painting the portrait of dorian gray , a handsome young man who is basil s ultimate muse . while sitting for the painting , dorian listens to lord henry espousing his hedonistic world view , and begins to think that beauty is the only aspect of life worth pursuing . this prompts dorian to wish that the painted image of himself would age instead of himself . under the hedonist influence of lord henry , dorian fully explores his sensuality . he discovers the actress sibyl vane , who performs shakespeare plays in a dingy , working - class theatre . dorian approaches and courts her , and soon proposes marriage . the enamoured sibyl calls him prince charming , and swoons with the happiness of being loved , but her protective brother , james warns that if prince charming harms her , he will murder dorian gray . dorian invites basil and lord henry to see sibyl perform in romeo and juliet . sibyl , too enamoured with dorian to act , performs poorly , which makes both basil and lord henry think dorian has fallen in love with sibyl because of her beauty instead of her acting talent . embarrassed , dorian rejects sibyl , telling her that acting was her beauty ; without that , she no longer interests him . on returning home , dorian notices that the portrait has changed ; his wish has come true , and the man in the portrait bears a subtle sneer of cruelty . conscience - stricken and lonely , dorian decides to reconcile with sibyl , but he is too late , as lord henry informs him that sibyl killed herself by swallowing prussic acid . dorian then understands that , where his life is headed , lust and good looks shall suffice . dorian locks the portrait up , and over the following eighteen years , he experiments with every vice , influenced by a morally poisonous french novel that lord henry wotton gave him . [ the narrative does not reveal the title of the french novel , but , at trial , wilde said that the novel dorian gray read was à rebours ( against nature ' , 1884 ) , by joris - karl huysmans . ] one night , before leaving for paris , basil goes to dorian s house to ask him about rumours of his self - indulgent sensualism . dorian does not deny his debauchery , and takes basil to see the portrait . the portrait has become so hideous that basil is only able to identify it as his work by the signature he affixes to all his portraits . basil is horrified , and beseeches dorian to pray for salvation . in anger , dorian blames his fate on basil , and stabs him dead . dorian then calmly blackmails an old friend , the scientist alan campbell , into using his knowledge of chemistry to destroy the body of basil hallward . alan later kills himself over the deed . to escape the guilt of his crime , dorian goes to an opium den , where james vane is unknowingly present . james had been seeking vengeance upon dorian ever since sibyl killed herself , but had no leads to pursue : the only thing he knew about dorian was the name sibyl called him by , prince charming . in the opium den however he hears someone refer to dorian as prince charming , and he accosts dorian . dorian deceives james into believing that he is too young to have known sibyl , who killed herself eighteen years earlier , as his face is still that of a young man . james relents and releases dorian , but is then approached by a woman from the opium den who reproaches james for not killing dorian . she confirms that the man was dorian gray and explains that he has not aged in eighteen years . james runs after dorian , but he has gone . james then begins to stalk dorian , causing dorian to fear for his life . however during a shooting party , one of the hunters accidentally kills james vane who was lurking in a thicket . on returning to london , dorian tells lord henry that he will be good from then on ; his new probity begins with not breaking the heart of the naïve hetty merton , his current romantic interest . dorian wonders if his new - found goodness has reverted the corruption in the picture , but when he looks he sees only an even uglier image of himself . from that , dorian understands that his true motives for the self - sacrifice of moral reformation were the vanity and curiosity of his quest for new experiences . deciding that only full confession will absolve him of wrongdoing , dorian decides to destroy the last vestige of his conscience , and the only piece of evidence remaining of his crimes — the picture . in a rage , he takes the knife with which he murdered basil hallward , and stabs the picture . the servants of the house awaken on hearing a cry from the locked room ; on the street , passers - by who also heard the cry fetch the police . on entering the locked room , the servants find an unknown old man , stabbed in the heart , his face and figure withered and decrepit . the servants identify the disfigured corpse by the rings on his fingers to belong to their master ; beside him is the picture of dorian gray , restored to its original beauty A1 prince charming A2 prince charming .

Sample output 200 1081 two native americans , and gold from a spanish ship that he claims was unable to continue its journey . elizabeth commands that the native americans be treated well and refuses to accept the gold . elizabeth is attracted to raleigh , enthralled by his tales of exploration , and asks bess throckmorton ( abbie cornish ) , her most favored lady - in - waiting , to observe him . bess also finds raleigh attractive and secretly begins an affair with him . elizabeth seeks guidance from her astrologer , dr . john dee ( david threlfall ) , who predicts that two empires will go to war . however , he can not predict which will triumph over the other , leaving elizabeth to ponder her and england s fate . jesuits in london conspire with philip to assassinate elizabeth and replace her with mary , in what philip calls the english enterprise , historically known as the babington plot . from her imprisonment , mary sends secret correspondence to the jesuits , who recruit anthony babington ( eddie redmayne ) to assassinate elizabeth . walsingham continues to warn elizabeth of spain s rising power and of the catholics ' plots against her . however she , unlike her predecessor and half - sister mary i of england , refuses to force her people to share her religious beliefs . even so , those conspiring against elizabeth are being hunted and murdered , including bess s cousin , sir francis throckmorton and his father , whom bess had failed to protect . after learning of her cousin s torture and death at walsingham s hands , bess turns to raleigh for comfort . walsingham s brother , a papist , who knows of the plot against elizabeth is jailed . walsingham reveals spain s plot to elizabeth , who angrily confronts the spanish diplomats . the spanish ambassador feigns ignorance , accuses elizabeth of receiving spanish gold from pirates , and insinuates that she has a sexual relationship with raleigh . in response , a sword fight nearly ensues between the queen s male escorts and the spanish contingent , and elizabeth throws the spaniards out of court . meanwhile , philip is cutting down the forests of spain to build the spanish armada , to invade england . mary writes letters condoning the plot . babington storms into a cathedral where elizabeth is praying and points a gun at her . elizabeth opens her arms , seemingly fearless . he pulls the trigger , and the gun fires . at first walsingham is unable to discern why the gun was harmless , though it is later revealed by the traitor , in the torture chamber , that there was no bullet in the gun . elizabeth learns of mary s involvement in the plot , and walsingham insists mary be executed to quell any possible revolt . elizabeth is reluctant , but nevertheless agrees . mary is tried for high treason and is beheaded , after ascending the block in a blood - red dress ( red being the catholic liturgical color for martyrs ) . walsingham sees that this was part of the jesuits ' plan all along . philip had never intended mary to become queen , but since the pope and other catholic leaders regarded mary as the true queen of england , philip uses mary s death to obtain papal approval for war . the murder of the last legitimate catholic in the line of succession gives philip the pretext he needs to invade england and place his daughter on the throne as a puppet monarch , and he oversees the departure of the armada from cรกdiz . in england , raleigh asks to leave for the new world , which elizabeth forbids , instead knighting him and making him captain of the royal guard . bess discovers she is pregnant with raleigh s child , and after telling him the news , she pleads with him to leave . he chooses not to , and the couple marries in secret . elizabeth confronts bess a few weeks later ; bess confesses that she is indeed pregnant with raleigh s child , and that raleigh is her husband . an enraged elizabeth berates bess , reminding her that she can not marry without royal consent . feeling betrayed , the queen banishes bess from court and has raleigh imprisoned for the crime of seducing a ward of the queen . walsingham arranges for his brother william to be released and taken to france , on the condition that he must never return to england . the armada begins its approach up the english channel , and elizabeth forgives bess and sets raleigh free to join sir francis drake in the battle . elizabeth gives her speech to the troops at tilbury , while seated on a war horse and wearing full plate armour . the ships of the armada vastly outnumber england s , but at the last moment , a major storm blows the armada toward the beaches , endangering its formation and ships . the ships of the armada drop anchor , and the armada becomes a sitting duck for english fire ships A1 the armada had many more ships . A2 england s ships were greatly outnumbered by spain s armada

Sample output 178 447 civilised countries — see , for instance , france — so long as the jewish question is not solved on the political level . the book concludes : therefore i believe that a wondrous generation of jews will spring into existence . the maccabeans will rise again . let me repeat once more my opening words : the jews who wish for a state will have it . we shall live at last as free men on our own soil , and die peacefully in our own homes . the world will be freed by our liberty , enriched by our wealth , magnified by our greatness . and whatever we attempt there to accomplish for our own welfare , will react powerfully and beneficially for the good of humanity . herzl opposed the efforts already made by zionist groups to settle jews in ottoman - controlled palestine by arguing that important experiments in colonization have been made , though on the mistaken principle of a gradual infiltration of jews . an infiltration is bound to end badly . it continues till the inevitable moment when the native population feels itself threatened , and forces the government to stop a further influx of jews . immigration is consequently futile unless we have the sovereign right to continue such immigration . ( quoted from the jewish state , translated by sylvie d’avigdor , nutt , london , 1896 , and reprinted by dover , 1988 , p . 95 . ) for that reason , herzl , both in der judenstaat , and in his political activity on behalf of zionism A1 france A2 france

( rossetti hints that the goblin men resemble animalsâfor example , having faces like wombats or cats , and possessing tails . ) longing for the goblin fruits but having no money , the impulsive laura offers a lock of her hair and a tear more rare than pearl . laura gorges on the delicious fruit in a sort of bacchic frenzy , then once she is finished , after picking up one of the seeds , returns home in an ecstatic trance . lizzie , waiting at home , and full of wise upbraidings , reminds laura about the cautionary tale of jeanie , another girl , who , having likewise partaken of the goblins ' fruits , died just at the beginning of winter , after a long and pathetic decline . strangely , no grass grows over jeanie s grave . laura dismisses her sister s worries , and says she shall return to the goblins the next night and return with more fruits for herself and lizzie . that night , the sisters go to sleep in their shared bed . the next day , as laura and lizzie go about their work in the house , laura dreamily longs for the coming evening s meeting with the goblins . however , at the stream that evening , as she strains to hear the usual goblin chants and cries , laura discovers to her horror that , although lizzie still hears the goblins ' voices , she can not . unable to buy more of the forbidden fruit , and sickening for the lack of it , laura falls into a slow physical deterioration and depression . as winter approaches , she withers away , aging at an unnatural rate and physically unable to do her accustomed household work . one day she remembers the saved seed and plants it , but nothing grows . months pass , and lizzie realizes that laura is on the verge of death . lizzie resolves to visit the goblins to buy some of their fruit , hoping to soothe laura s pain . carrying a silver penny , lizzie goes down to the brook and is greeted in a friendly way by the goblins , who invite her to sit and dine with them . when they realize , however , that the lizzie means to pay with mere silver to buy the goblin - fruits to help another person , they turn upon the girl . the goblins viciously pummel and assault lizzie , and try to feed her their fruits by force . in the process , they drench the brave girl in fruit juice and pulpâbut lizzie ingests none of the goblin fruit . lizzie escapes and runs home , hoping that laura will eat and drink the pulp and juice from her body . her dying sister does so , but the taste of the fruit repulses her rather than satisfies her hunger . laura then undergoes a violent transformation of such intensity that her life seems to hang in the balance . by morning , however , laura is restored , emotionally , physically , and mentally . the last stanza attests that both laura and lizzie A1 laura and lizzie A2 laura and lizzie

Sample output 248 1011 an ideal husband âthat is , a model spouse in both private and public life that she can worship : thus sir robert must remain unimpeachable in all his decisions . sir robert complies with the lady s wishes and apparently seals his doom . also toward the end of actâ i , mabel and lord goring come upon a diamond brooch that lord goring gave someone many years ago . goring takes the brooch and asks that mabel inform him if anyone comes to retrieve it . in the second act , which also takes place at sir robert s house , lord goring urges sir robert to fight mrs . cheveley and admit his guilt to his wife . he also reveals that he and mrs . cheveley were formerly engaged . after finishing his conversation with sir robert , goring engages in flirtatious banter with mabel . he also takes lady chiltern aside and obliquely urges her to be less morally inflexible and more forgiving . once goring leaves , mrs . cheveley appears , unexpected , in search of a brooch she lost the previous evening . incensed at sir robert s reneging on his promise , she ultimately exposes sir robert to his wife once they are both in the room . unable to accept a sir robert now unmasked , lady chiltern then denounces her husband and refuses to forgive him . in the third act , set in lord goring s home , goring receives a pink letter from lady chiltern asking for his help , a letter that might be read as a compromising love note . just as goring receives this note , however , his father , lord caversham , drops in and demands to know when his son will marry . a visit from sir robert , who seeks further counsel from goring , follows . meanwhile , mrs . cheveley arrives unexpectedly and , misrecognized by the butler as the woman goring awaits , is ushered into lord goring s drawing room . while she waits , she finds lady chiltern s letter . ultimately , sir robert discovers mrs . cheveley in the drawing room and , convinced of an affair between these two former lovers , angrily storms out of the house . when she and lord goring confront each other , mrs . cheveley makes a proposal . claiming to still love goring from their early days of courtship , she offers to exchange sir robert s letter for her old beau s hand in marriage . lord goring declines , accusing her of defiling love by reducing courtship to a vulgar transaction and ruining the chilterns ' marriage . he then springs his trap . removing the diamond brooch from his desk drawer , he binds it to cheveley s wrist with a hidden device . goring then reveals how the item came into her possession . apparently mrs . cheveley stole it from his cousin , mary berkshire , years ago . to avoid arrest , cheveley must trade the incriminating letter for her release from the bejewelled handcuff . after goring obtains and burns the letter , however , mrs . cheveley steals lady chiltern s note from his desk . vengefully she plans to send it to sir robert misconstrued as a love letter addressed to the dandified lord . mrs . cheveley exits the house in triumph . the final act , which returns to grosvenor square , resolves the many plot complications sketched above with a decidedly happy ending . lord goring proposes to and is accepted by mabel . lord caversham informs his son that sir robert has denounced the argentine canal scheme before the house . lady chiltern then appears , and lord goring informs her that sir robert s letter has been destroyed but that mrs . cheveley has stolen her letter and plans to use it to destroy her marriage . at that moment , sir robert enters while reading lady chiltern s letter , but as the letter does not have the name of the addressee , he assumes it is meant for him , and reads it as a letter of forgiveness . the two reconcile . lady chiltern initially agrees to support sir robert s decision to renounce his career in politics , but lord goring dissuades her from allowing her husband to resign . when sir robert refuses lord goring his sister s hand in marriage , still believing he has taken up with mrs A1 having an ideal husband .

but sir henry abused and spurned his nephew as a rebel , and at alice s entreaty he bade them farewell , as he feared , for ever . on his way to the lodge he met his royalist friend , captain wildrake , whom he was sheltering in spite of his politics , and determined to send him with an appeal to cromwell to reinstate his uncle at woodstock . on reaching windsor , the captain , disguised as a roundhead , obtained an interview with oliver cromwell , and a compliance with everard s request , on condition that he would aid in securing the murdered king s son , in the event of his seeking refuge with the lees . armed with the warrant of ejectment , the colonel and wildrake , accompanied by the mayor and the minister , visited the commissioners during their evening carouse , and took part in endeavouring to ascertain the cause of some startling occurrences by which they had been disturbed . everard made his way alone to a dark gallery , in which he fancied he heard his cousin s voice , and suddenly felt a sword at his throat . meeting wildrake as he regained the hall , they hurried off to the hut where they found dr rochecliffe reading the church service to sir henry and his daughter ; and , after a reconciliation between uncle and nephew , the cousins were allowed a private interview , during which alice warned her lover against betraying the king . returning to the lodge they were told of other unaccountable events ; and during the night everard was ordered by an apparition to change his quarters . the sentinels also declared that they had heard strange sounds , and the commissioners decided to retire to the village inn . master holdenough , too , confessed that he had been terribly shocked by the reflection in a mirror of the figure of a college friend whom he had seen drowned . the following day sir henry lee was induced to resume his post , and his son albert arrived with one louis kerneguy , whom he introduced as his scotch page . sir henry having no suspicion who his guest really was treated him without ceremony ; and while dr rochecliffe and the colonel were planning for his escape to holland , the disguised charles amused himself by endeavouring to gain alice s love ; but , in spite of a declaration of his rank , she made him ashamed of his suit . a quarrel , however , having arisen between him and everard , she evinced her loyalty by preventing a duel they had arranged , at the risk of her reputation and the loss of her cousin s affection . a similar attempt by tomkins to trifle with phoebe was punished by a death - blow from joliffe . the next evening everard and his friend , and holdenough , were unexpectedly made prisoners by cromwell , who , having received intelligence of their knowledge of the king s sojourn at woodstock , had brought a large force to secure him . wildrake , however , managed to send his page spitfire to the lodge to warn them , and while alice acted as charles s guide , albert , in his dress , concealed himself in rosamond s tower . cromwell and his soldiers arrived soon afterwards with dr rochecliffe and joliffe , whom they had seized as they were burying tomkins , and , having searched all the rooms and passages in vain , they proceeded to blow up the tower . albert , however , leapt from it just before the explosion , and cromwell was furious when he discovered the deception . in his rage he ordered the execution of the old knight and all his abettors , including his dog ; but afterwards released them , with the exception of albert , who was imprisoned , and subsequently fell in the battle of dunkirk ( 1658 ) . alice returned in safety , with the news that the king had effected his escape , and a letter from him to sir henry , approving of her marriage with everard , whose political opinions had been considerably influenced by recent events . eight years later wildrake arrived at brussels with news for charles . after cromwell s son richard abdicated , the protectorate was abolished and the country descended into chaos . order was restored when george monck , the governor of scotland , marched into the city of london with his army and forced the rump parliament to re - admit members of the long parliament excluded during pride s purge . the long parliament dissolved itself and for the first time in almost 20 years , there was a general election . the convention parliament assembled and voted for charles ' restoration . in his progress to london , charles , escorted by a brilliant retinue , amidst shouts of welcome from his assembled subjects , dismounted to salute a family group in which the central figure was the old knight of ditchley , whose venerable features expressed his appreciation of the happiness of once more pressing his sovereign s hand , and whose contented death A1 rev . nehemiah holdenough ceded the pulpit .

Sample output 106 1091 1968 fa cup match between leeds , the leaders of the first division and derby , who were struggling near the bottom of the second division . clough , assuming revie to be a similar man to himself , as they grew up in the same part of middlesbrough and both played for sunderland , made many preparations for the match ; come the day of the match however , revie failed to even acknowledge clough upon entering the baseball ground . derby eventually lost 2–0 . although clough initially blames the brutality of the leeds players , he and taylor recognise that their side are not good on a technical level . so they sign veteran dave mackay ( brian mccardie ) , along with several other young players . chairman sam longson ( jim broadbent ) is extremely anxious about the investment , as well as the fact that clough did not consult him before signing mackay . however , in 1969 derby are promoted . they once again face leeds , only to lose 5–0 . the club win their first ever league championship in 1972 , meaning a european cup campaign the following year . they go through to the semi - finals against juventus . unfortunately , against longson s advice , clough uses his best squad in the last match before the semi - final , against leeds , purely out of pride and determination to beat revie . they suffer injuries and billy bremner ( stephen graham ) sarcastically wishes clough well for the semi - final . juventus defeat them 3 - 1 , and clough publicly lambasts longson . taylor then suffers a heart attack , and clough tries to secure his position by offering his and taylor s resignations in a protest against the chairman s unwilligness to fund further signings . to his horror , the club accepts their resignations and bans them from entering the baseball ground again ( although clough later sneaks in as a supporter ) . derby fans ' outrage raises clough s hopes of being reinstated , and he is backed by the majority of his players as well , but former player dave mackay is appointed manager instead . derby fans quickly lose interest and clough loses all hope of getting his job back . he and taylor are then offered jobs at brighton & hove albion . they agree to take the jobs after taking an all - expenses - paid holiday in majorca . during the holiday that summer , clough agrees to take control of leeds after being approached by their representatives . taylor , however , argues the case for staying at brighton , and after a bitter quarrel , the two go their separate ways . back in the storyline s present . clough alienates his players in their first training session , first by telling them that they can throw away any awards they have won because they never won any of them fairly , and then making them start with a 7-a - side game , which bremner points out don revie never made them do . clough reminds them that he is not mr revie and threatens a severe punishment for any player who mentions the former manager s name or methods again . the season starts with a charity shield match against fa cup winners liverpool at wembley , which is widely anticipated as both the final match of liverpool manager bill shankly and clough s debut as leeds manager . unfortunately , the event is marred when leeds s captain , billy bremner gets into a fight with kevin keegan . both are sent off , and in turn throw their shirts off and walk off the pitch bare - chested in defiance . leeds lose the match on penalties , and bremner is given a two - month suspension from football , forcing leeds to start the season without their influential captain . as a result , leeds suffer a horrendous start to the season and are in danger of relegation only one season after winning the title . after bremner and the players air their grievances to the board , the club terminates clough s contract after just 44 days - though he forces them to pay an enormous severance package . afterwards , clough agrees to do a final interview with yorkshire television , but finds revie there to confront him , bringing the two face to face at last . clough accuses revie of being cold - hearted ' and fundamentally dishonest ' , both as a person and a football manager , and revie in turn brands clough as inflexible and egocentric ' . clough brings up the incident in the 1968 fa cup , and revie claims to have not known who the rookie manager was at the time ( a doubtful claim considering that revie was known for meticulously researching every opponent his team faced ) . after the interview , clough drives down to brighton to patch things up with taylor . it involves clough literally on his knees , grovelling at taylor s dictation , and they are reconciled . in the film s epilogue , the audience is told that don revie failed as england manager , and afterwards never worked in football in his home country again , spending the rest of his career working in the middle east , where he was accused of financial mismanagement . brian clough and peter taylor , meanwhile , reunited at the small , provincial club ' nottingham forest , where they repeated their prior achievements with derby by taking them up and winning the first division . they then bettered both revie and their own spell at derby by winning two european cups in succession , in 1979 and 1980 A1 1968 A2 1968

Sample output 3 488 cratylus is the correctness of names ( περὶ ὀνομάτων ὀρθότητος ) , in other words , it is a critique on the subject of naming ( baxter ) . when discussing a ὄνομα ( onoma ) and how it would relate to its subject , socrates compares the original creation of a word to the work of an artist . an artist uses color to express the essence of his subject in a painting . in much the same way , the creator of words uses letters containing certain sounds to express the essence of a word s subject . there is a letter that is best for soft things , one for liquid things , and so on . he comments ; the best possible way to speak consists in using names all ( or most ) of which are like the things they name ( that is , are appropriate to them ) , while the worst is to use the opposite kind of names . one countering position , held by hermogenes , is that names have come about due to custom and convention . they do not express the essence of their subject , so they can be swapped with something unrelated by the individuals or communities who use them . the line between the two perspectives is often blurred . during more than half of the dialogue , socrates makes guesses at hermogenes ' request as to where names and words have come from . these include the names of the olympian gods , personified deities , and many words that describe abstract concepts . he examines whether , for example , giving names of streams to cronus and rhea ( ροή – flow or space ) are purely accidental . do n't you think he who gave to the ancestors of the other gods the names rhea and cronus had the same thought as heracleitus ? do you think he gave both of them the names of streams ( ῥευμάτων ὀνόματα ) merely by chance ? the greek term ῥεῦμα may refer to the flow of any medium and is not restricted to the flow of water or liquids . many of the words which socrates uses as examples may have come from an idea originally linked to the name , but have changed over time . those of which he can not find a link , he often assumes have come from foreign origins or have changed so much as to lose all resemblance to the original word . he states , names have been so twisted in all manner of ways , that i should not be surprised if the old language when compared with that now in use would appear to us to be a barbarous tongue . the final theory of relations between name and object named is posited by cratylus , a disciple of heraclitus A1 this story is a literary dialogue . A2 it is a critique on naming .

Sample output 17 564 miranda and jane sawyer . until this time , she has lived on the family farm . rebecca is the second eldest of seven children . most of the children have fanciful names , such as marquis and jenny lind , influenced by their father s artistic background ( rebecca is named after both the heroines in ivanhoe ) . the family is quite poor , due to the number of children , mr . randall s inability to stick to a job , and the farm being mortgaged . at the beginning of the novel , he has been dead for three years and the family is barely scraping by . rebecca s stay with her aunt is a chance to improve her opportunities in life and to ease the strain on her family s budget , with one less mouth to feed . despite her impoverished background , rebecca is imaginative and charming . she often composes little poems and songs to express her feelings or to amuse her younger brothers and sisters . it is she who named their farm sunnybrook . miranda and jane had wanted hannah , the eldest sister , due to her pragmatic nature and household skills , but her mother needs her at home for the same reason . she sends rebecca instead . miranda is unimpressed by rebecca s imagination and sallow complexion and says she s the image of her shiftless father , lorenzo demedici randall . miranda determines to do her duty and train rebecca to be a proper young lady , so she will not shame the sawyer name . jane takes on the role of rebecca s protector and acts as a buffer between her niece and her sister . jane teaches rebecca to sew , cook and manage a household . rebecca s liveliness and curiosity brighten jane s life and refresh her spirit . although rebecca strives to win miranda s approval she finds it hard to live up to miranda s rigid standards . rebecca is up against miranda s view of her as all randall and no sawyer . the middle of the novel is for the most part a description of life at riverboro and its inhabitants . important characters are jeremiah cobb and his wife sarah , who first encounter rebecca s charm ; rebecca s schoolfellow and best friend , emma jane perkins ; and adam ladd , a young businessman who takes an interest in rebecca s education . adam meets rebecca when she and emma jane are selling soap to help a poor family receive a lamp as a premium . rebecca nicknames him mr . aladdin . rebecca proves to be a good student , especially in english , and goes on to attend high school in wareham . in the last section of the book rebecca has become a young lady with the same high spirit and a talent for writing . she applies for a teaching place in augusta , but her mother falls ill and rebecca must return to care for her and the farm . while rebecca is away from riverboro , miranda dies and leaves the sawyer house and land to rebecca . a railway company will buy sunnybrook farm A1 sunnybrook farm A2 sunnybrook farm

Sample output 160 616 his father , a moral and law - respecting citizen , turns falder over to the police . the second act , in the court room , shows justice in the very process of manufacture . the scene equals in dramatic power and psychologic verity the great court scene in resurrection . young falder , a youth of twenty - three , stands before the bar . ruth , his faithful sweetheart , full of love and devotion , burns with anxiety to save the young man , whose affection for her has brought about his present predicament . falder is defended by lawyer frome , whose speech to the jury is a masterpiece of social philosophy . he does not attempt to dispute the mere fact that his client had altered the check ; and though he pleads temporary aberration in his defense , the argument is based on a social consciousness as fundamental and all - embracing as the roots of our social ills . he shows falder to have faced the alternative of seeing the beloved woman murdered by her brutal husband , whom she can not divorce , or of taking the law into his own hands . he pleads with the jury not to turn the weak young man into a criminal by condemning him to prison . in prison the young , inexperienced convict soon finds himself the victim of the terrible system . the authorities admit that young falder is mentally and physically in bad shape , but nothing can be done in the matter : many others are in a similar position , and the quarters are inadequate . the third scene of the third act takes place in falder s prison cell . falder leaves the prison , a broken man . thanks to ruth s pleading , the firm of james how & son is willing to take falder back in their employ , on condition that he give up ruth . falder resents this : it is then that falder learns the awful news that the woman he loves had been driven by the chariot wheel of justice to sell herself . at this moment the police appear to drag falder back to prison for failing to report to the authorities as ticket - of - leave man . completely overcome by the inexorability of his fate , falder throws himself down the stairs , breaking his neck . the socio - revolutionary significance of justice consists not only in the portrayal of the in - human system which grinds the falders and honeywills , but even more so in the utter helplessness of society as expressed in the words of the senior clerk , cokeson A1 walter how A2 robert cokeson

Sample output 106 1091 1968 fa cup match between leeds , the leaders of the first division and derby , who were struggling near the bottom of the second division . clough , assuming revie to be a similar man to himself , as they grew up in the same part of middlesbrough and both played for sunderland , made many preparations for the match ; come the day of the match however , revie failed to even acknowledge clough upon entering the baseball ground . derby eventually lost 2–0 . although clough initially blames the brutality of the leeds players , he and taylor recognise that their side are not good on a technical level . so they sign veteran dave mackay ( brian mccardie ) , along with several other young players . chairman sam longson ( jim broadbent ) is extremely anxious about the investment , as well as the fact that clough did not consult him before signing mackay . however , in 1969 derby are promoted . they once again face leeds , only to lose 5–0 . the club win their first ever league championship in 1972 , meaning a european cup campaign the following year . they go through to the semi - finals against juventus . unfortunately , against longson s advice , clough uses his best squad in the last match before the semi - final , against leeds , purely out of pride and determination to beat revie . they suffer injuries and billy bremner ( stephen graham ) sarcastically wishes clough well for the semi - final . juventus defeat them 3 - 1 , and clough publicly lambasts longson . taylor then suffers a heart attack , and clough tries to secure his position by offering his and taylor s resignations in a protest against the chairman s unwilligness to fund further signings . to his horror , the club accepts their resignations and bans them from entering the baseball ground again ( although clough later sneaks in as a supporter ) . derby fans ' outrage raises clough s hopes of being reinstated , and he is backed by the majority of his players as well , but former player dave mackay is appointed manager instead . derby fans quickly lose interest and clough loses all hope of getting his job back . he and taylor are then offered jobs at brighton & hove albion . they agree to take the jobs after taking an all - expenses - paid holiday in majorca . during the holiday that summer , clough agrees to take control of leeds after being approached by their representatives . taylor , however , argues the case for staying at brighton , and after a bitter quarrel , the two go their separate ways . back in the storyline s present . clough alienates his players in their first training session , first by telling them that they can throw away any awards they have won because they never won any of them fairly , and then making them start with a 7-a - side game , which bremner points out don revie never made them do . clough reminds them that he is not mr revie and threatens a severe punishment for any player who mentions the former manager s name or methods again . the season starts with a charity shield match against fa cup winners liverpool at wembley , which is widely anticipated as both the final match of liverpool manager bill shankly and clough s debut as leeds manager . unfortunately , the event is marred when leeds s captain , billy bremner gets into a fight with kevin keegan . both are sent off , and in turn throw their shirts off and walk off the pitch bare - chested in defiance . leeds lose the match on penalties , and bremner is given a two - month suspension from football , forcing leeds to start the season without their influential captain . as a result , leeds suffer a horrendous start to the season and are in danger of relegation only one season after winning the title . after bremner and the players air their grievances to the board , the club terminates clough s contract after just 44 days - though he forces them to pay an enormous severance package . afterwards , clough agrees to do a final interview with yorkshire television , but finds revie there to confront him , bringing the two face to face at last . clough accuses revie of being cold - hearted ' and fundamentally dishonest ' , both as a person and a football manager , and revie in turn brands clough as inflexible and egocentric ' . clough brings up the incident in the 1968 fa cup , and revie claims to have not known who the rookie manager was at the time ( a doubtful claim considering that revie was known for meticulously researching every opponent his team faced ) . after the interview , clough drives down to brighton to patch things up with taylor . it involves clough literally on his knees , grovelling at taylor s dictation , and they are reconciled . in the film s epilogue , the audience is told that don revie failed as england manager , and afterwards never worked in football in his home country again , spending the rest of his career working in the middle east , where he was accused of financial mismanagement . brian clough and peter taylor , meanwhile , reunited at the small , provincial club ' nottingham forest , where they repeated their prior achievements with derby by taking them up and winning the first division . they then bettered both revie and their own spell at derby by winning two european cups in succession , in 1979 and 1980 A1 1968 A2 1968

Sample output 510 803 she is bitten by a venomous snake near siddhartha s river . siddhartha recognizes her and realizes that the boy is his own child . after kamala s death , siddhartha attempts to console and raise the furiously resistant boy , until one day the child flees altogether . although siddhartha is desperate to find his runaway son , vasudeva urges him to let the boy find his own path , much like siddhartha did himself in his youth . listening to the river with vasudeva , siddhartha realizes that time is an illusion and that all of his feelings and experiences , even those of suffering , are part of a great and ultimately jubilant fellowship of all things connected in the cyclical unity of nature . after siddhartha s moment of illumination , vasudeva claims that his work is done and he must depart into the woods , leaving siddhartha peacefully fulfilled and alone once more . toward the end of his life , govinda hears about an enlightened ferryman and travels to siddhartha , not initially recognizing him as his old childhood friend . govinda asks the now - elderly siddhartha to relate his wisdom and siddhartha replies that for every true statement there is an opposite one that is also true ; that language and the confines of time lead people to adhere to one fixed belief that does not account for the fullness of the truth . because nature works in a self - sustaining cycle , every entity carries in it the potential for its opposite and so the world must always be considered complete . siddhartha simply urges people to identify and love the world in its completeness . siddhartha then requests that govinda kiss his forehead A1 he is willing to live against his beliefs for the sake of the love of kamala A2 he is willing to chase materialistic rather than spiritual pursuits , and becomes wealthy .

Sample output 5 431 nepalese plain land - kapilvastu . siddhartha decides to leave behind his home in the hope of gaining spiritual illumination by becoming an ascetic wandering beggar of the shramanas . joined by his best friend govinda , siddhartha fasts , becomes homeless , renounces all personal possessions , and intensely meditates , eventually seeking and personally speaking with gautama , the famous buddha , or enlightened one . afterward , both siddhartha and govinda acknowledge the elegance of the buddha s teachings . although govinda hastily joins the buddha s order , siddhartha does not follow , claiming that the buddha s philosophy , though supremely wise , does not account for the necessarily distinct experiences of each person . he argues that the individual seeks an absolutely unique and personal meaning that can not be presented to him by a teacher . he thus resolves to carry on his quest alone . siddhartha crosses a river , and the generous ferryman , whom siddhartha is unable to pay , merrily predicts that siddhartha will return to the river later to compensate him in some way . venturing onward toward city life , siddhartha discovers kamala , the most beautiful woman he has yet seen . kamala , a courtesan , notes siddhartha s handsome appearance and fast wit , telling him that he must become wealthy to win her affections so that she may teach him the art of love . although siddhartha despised materialistic pursuits as a shramana , he agrees now to kamala s suggestions . she directs him to the employ of kamaswami , a local businessman , and insists that he have kamaswami treat him as an equal rather than an underling . siddhartha easily succeeds , providing a voice of patience and tranquility , which siddhartha learned from his days as an ascetic , against kamaswami s fits of passion . thus siddhartha becomes a rich man and kamala s lover , though in his middle years he realizes that the luxurious lifestyle he has chosen is merely a game , empty of spiritual fulfillment . leaving the fast - paced bustle of the city , siddhartha returns to the river and thinks of killing himself . he is saved only by an internal experience of the holy word , om . the very next morning siddhartha briefly reconnects with govinda , who is passing through the area as a wandering buddhist . siddhartha decides to live out the rest of his life in the presence of the spiritually inspirational river A1 many of siddhartha s revelations happen on the banks of the river .

A2 he owes that much in back taxes .

Sample output 7 719 lawyer fletcher reede ( carrey ) loves his son max ( cooper ) , but his inability to keep his promises and the compulsive lying he engages in for his career often cause problems between them and with his former wife audrey ( tierney ) , who has become involved with another man named jerry ( elwes ) . in court , fletcher is willing to exaggerate the stories of his clients , and his current client , the self - centered , money - grabbing samantha cole ( tilly ) has garnered the attention of mr . allen , a partner at the law firm in which fletcher works . if fletcher wins this case , it will bring his firm a fortune and boost his career . fletcher calls and lies to audrey about missing max s birthday due to work , when he is actually having sex with his boss , miranda , in order to get a promotion . dejected , max makes a birthday wish that for one day his father can not tell a lie . the wish immediately comes true , and fletcher accidentally tells miranda he has had better after they have sex . the following day , fletcher immediately realizes that he is unable to do anything dishonest . he can not lie , mislead , or even deceive by withholding a true answer , often uncontrollably blurting out offensive and painful truths that anger his co - workers , and his car ends up in an impound for several parking violations . this comes to a head when he realizes that he is unable to even ask questions when he knows the answer will be a lie , which is inconvenient as samantha and her alleged affair partner kenneth faulk are willing to commit perjury to win the high profile case and he can not ask him the questions they have been given answers for . realizing that max had wished for this to happen , fletcher tries to convince him that adults need to lie , but can not give any type of answer at why he should continue to lie to his son . fletcher also figures out that since max wished for him to tell the truth for only one day , he tries to do what he can to delay samantha s case since the magic wish will expire at 8:15 p.m. , 24 hours after max made the wish . things only get worse for fletcher as he loses his loyal assistant greta after admitting he had lied about the miserly reasons for denying her pay raises and the expensive gifts he gave her , and audrey tells fletcher that she and max are moving to boston with jerry in order to prevent any more heartbreaks from fletcher s broken promises . fletcher s erratic behavior in court leads to several questions of his sanity as he objects to himself and badgers and provokes his own witnesses into admitting they had an affair against samantha and her husband s prenuptial agreement . he even goes so far as to beat himself up and claim that someone attacked him in order to try and avoid the case , but when asked if he feels like he can continue , he ca n't deny it and he says yes . during the case , fletcher finds a technicality that samantha lied that she was underage when she signed the prenup prior to her marriage , rendering it void and entitling her to half of mr . cole s estate , allowing him to win the case truthfully . but when samantha decides to contest full custody of their children , who mr . cole dearly loves , just because she wants more money from the child support payments , fletcher regrets mentioning the technicality after seeing mrs . cole pull the children out of their father s arms , and shriek her demands for more money . realizing now that winning the case has punished the loving husband and rewarded the cheating wife , fletcher has a crisis of conscience and shouts at the judge demanding that he reverse the decision , but he is arrested for contempt of court A1 his career .

but sir henry abused and spurned his nephew as a rebel , and at alice s entreaty he bade them farewell , as he feared , for ever . on his way to the lodge he met his royalist friend , captain wildrake , whom he was sheltering in spite of his politics , and determined to send him with an appeal to cromwell to reinstate his uncle at woodstock . on reaching windsor , the captain , disguised as a roundhead , obtained an interview with oliver cromwell , and a compliance with everard s request , on condition that he would aid in securing the murdered king s son , in the event of his seeking refuge with the lees . armed with the warrant of ejectment , the colonel and wildrake , accompanied by the mayor and the minister , visited the commissioners during their evening carouse , and took part in endeavouring to ascertain the cause of some startling occurrences by which they had been disturbed . everard made his way alone to a dark gallery , in which he fancied he heard his cousin s voice , and suddenly felt a sword at his throat . meeting wildrake as he regained the hall , they hurried off to the hut where they found dr rochecliffe reading the church service to sir henry and his daughter ; and , after a reconciliation between uncle and nephew , the cousins were allowed a private interview , during which alice warned her lover against betraying the king . returning to the lodge they were told of other unaccountable events ; and during the night everard was ordered by an apparition to change his quarters . the sentinels also declared that they had heard strange sounds , and the commissioners decided to retire to the village inn . master holdenough , too , confessed that he had been terribly shocked by the reflection in a mirror of the figure of a college friend whom he had seen drowned . the following day sir henry lee was induced to resume his post , and his son albert arrived with one louis kerneguy , whom he introduced as his scotch page . sir henry having no suspicion who his guest really was treated him without ceremony ; and while dr rochecliffe and the colonel were planning for his escape to holland , the disguised charles amused himself by endeavouring to gain alice s love ; but , in spite of a declaration of his rank , she made him ashamed of his suit . a quarrel , however , having arisen between him and everard , she evinced her loyalty by preventing a duel they had arranged , at the risk of her reputation and the loss of her cousin s affection . a similar attempt by tomkins to trifle with phoebe was punished by a death - blow from joliffe . the next evening everard and his friend , and holdenough , were unexpectedly made prisoners by cromwell , who , having received intelligence of their knowledge of the king s sojourn at woodstock , had brought a large force to secure him . wildrake , however , managed to send his page spitfire to the lodge to warn them , and while alice acted as charles s guide , albert , in his dress , concealed himself in rosamond s tower . cromwell and his soldiers arrived soon afterwards with dr rochecliffe and joliffe , whom they had seized as they were burying tomkins , and , having searched all the rooms and passages in vain , they proceeded to blow up the tower . albert , however , leapt from it just before the explosion , and cromwell was furious when he discovered the deception . in his rage he ordered the execution of the old knight and all his abettors , including his dog ; but afterwards released them , with the exception of albert , who was imprisoned , and subsequently fell in the battle of dunkirk ( 1658 ) . alice returned in safety , with the news that the king had effected his escape , and a letter from him to sir henry , approving of her marriage with everard , whose political opinions had been considerably influenced by recent events . eight years later wildrake arrived at brussels with news for charles . after cromwell s son richard abdicated , the protectorate was abolished and the country descended into chaos . order was restored when george monck , the governor of scotland , marched into the city of london with his army and forced the rump parliament to re - admit members of the long parliament excluded during pride s purge . the long parliament dissolved itself and for the first time in almost 20 years , there was a general election . the convention parliament assembled and voted for charles ' restoration . in his progress to london , charles , escorted by a brilliant retinue , amidst shouts of welcome from his assembled subjects , dismounted to salute a family group in which the central figure was the old knight of ditchley , whose venerable features expressed his appreciation of the happiness of once more pressing his sovereign s hand , and whose contented death A1 rev . nehemiah holdenough ceded the pulpit .

come the day of the match however , revie failed to even acknowledge clough upon entering the baseball ground . derby eventually lost 2–0 . although clough initially blames the brutality of the leeds players , he and taylor recognise that their side are not good on a technical level . so they sign veteran dave mackay ( brian mccardie ) , along with several other young players . chairman sam longson ( jim broadbent ) is extremely anxious about the investment , as well as the fact that clough did not consult him before signing mackay . however , in 1969 derby are promoted . they once again face leeds , only to lose 5–0 . the club win their first ever league championship in 1972 , meaning a european cup campaign the following year . they go through to the semi - finals against juventus . unfortunately , against longson s advice , clough uses his best squad in the last match before the semi - final , against leeds , purely out of pride and determination to beat revie . they suffer injuries and billy bremner ( stephen graham ) sarcastically wishes clough well for the semi - final . juventus defeat them 3 - 1 , and clough publicly lambasts longson . taylor then suffers a heart attack , and clough tries to secure his position by offering his and taylor s resignations in a protest against the chairman s unwilligness to fund further signings . to his horror , the club accepts their resignations and bans them from entering the baseball ground again ( although clough later sneaks in as a supporter ) . derby fans ' outrage raises clough s hopes of being reinstated , and he is backed by the majority of his players as well , but former player dave mackay is appointed manager instead . derby fans quickly lose interest and clough loses all hope of getting his job back . he and taylor are then offered jobs at brighton & hove albion . they agree to take the jobs after taking an all - expenses - paid holiday in majorca . during the holiday that summer , clough agrees to take control of leeds after being approached by their representatives . taylor , however , argues the case for staying at brighton , and after a bitter quarrel , the two go their separate ways . back in the storyline s present . clough alienates his players in their first training session , first by telling them that they can throw away any awards they have won because they never won any of them fairly , and then making them start with a 7-a - side game , which bremner points out don revie never made them do . clough reminds them that he is not mr revie and threatens a severe punishment for any player who mentions the former manager s name or methods again . the season starts with a charity shield match against fa cup winners liverpool at wembley , which is widely anticipated as both the final match of liverpool manager bill shankly and clough s debut as leeds manager . unfortunately , the event is marred when leeds s captain , billy bremner gets into a fight with kevin keegan . both are sent off , and in turn throw their shirts off and walk off the pitch bare - chested in defiance . leeds lose the match on penalties , and bremner is given a two - month suspension from football , forcing leeds to start the season without their influential captain . as a result , leeds suffer a horrendous start to the season and are in danger of relegation only one season after winning the title . after bremner and the players air their grievances to the board , the club terminates clough s contract after just 44 days - though he forces them to pay an enormous severance package . afterwards , clough agrees to do a final interview with yorkshire television , but finds revie there to confront him , bringing the two face to face at last . clough accuses revie of being cold - hearted ' and fundamentally dishonest ' , both as a person and a football manager , and revie in turn brands clough as inflexible and egocentric ' . clough brings up the incident in the 1968 fa cup , and revie claims to have not known who the rookie manager was at the time ( a doubtful claim considering that revie was known for meticulously researching every opponent his team faced ) . after the interview , clough drives down to brighton to patch things up with taylor . it involves clough literally on his knees , grovelling at taylor s dictation , and they are reconciled . in the film s epilogue , the audience is told that don revie failed as england manager , and afterwards never worked in football in his home country again , spending the rest of his career working in the middle east , where he was accused of financial mismanagement . brian clough and peter taylor , meanwhile , reunited at the small , provincial club ' nottingham forest , where they repeated their prior achievements with derby by taking them up and winning the first division . they then bettered both revie and their own spell at derby by winning two european cups in succession , in 1979 and 1980 A1 1968 A2 1968

Sample output 177 1207 polly , is taking care of her siblings ) . the outing is fun , and they all get drunk on beer . on their way back in the dark , liza realises that jim blakeston is making a pass at her by holding her hand . back home , jim manages to speak to her alone and to steal a kiss from her . seemingly without considering either the moral implications or the consequences of her actions , liza feels attracted to jim . they never appear together in public because they do not want the other residents of vere street or their workmates to start talking about them . one of jim blakeston s first steps to win liza s heart is to go to a melodramatic play with her on saturday night . afterwards , he succeeds in seducing her ( although the graphic details of their sexual encounter are not explicitly described ) : liza , ' he said a whisper , will yer ? ' will i wot ? ' she said , looking down . you know , liza . sy , will yer ? ' na , ' she said . but in the end they do slide down into the darkness of the passage . ( the reader never learns whether at that time liza is still a virgin or not . ) liza is overwhelmed by love . ( thus began a time of love and joy . ) when autumn arrives and the nights get chillier , liza s secret meetings with jim become less comfortable and more trying ; they must meet in the third - class waiting - room of waterloo station . to liza s dismay , people do start talking about them despite their precautions . only liza s mother , a drunkard and a simple person , does n't know about their affair . after liza s friend sally gets married , her husband does n't want her to earn her own money , so he stops her from working at the factory ; besides , sally soon becomes pregnant . with sally married and stuck at home , and even tom seemingly shunning her , liza feels increasingly isolated , but her love for jim keeps her going . they do talk about their love affair : about the possibility of jim leaving his wife and children ( i dunno if i could get on without the kids ) ; about liza not being able to leave her mother , who needs her help ; about living somewhere else as if we was married , about bigamy — but , strangely , not about adultery . the novel builds up to a sad climax , suggesting that all men — with the possible exception of tom — are alike , since they all beat their wives , especially when they have been drinking . soon after their wedding , harry beats up sally just because she has been away from home chatting with a female neighbor ; he even hits his mother - in - law . when liza drops by , she stays a bit longer to comfort sally , which makes her late for her meeting with jim in front of a nearby pub . when she finally gets there , jim is aggressive towards her for being late . without really intending to , he hits her across the face ( it was n't the blow that urt me much ; it was the wy you was talkin ' ) and gives her a black eye . soon the situation deteriorates completely . mrs blakeston , who is pregnant again , opposes jim s affair with liza by refusing to talk to him , then goes around telling other people what she would do with liza if she caught her , and those people inform liza , who is frightened because she is weak and she knows mrs . blakeston is strong . one saturday afternoon in november , liza is on her way home from work when the angry mrs . blakeston confronts her , spits in her face , and physically attacks her . quickly a crowd gathers , not to abate the fight , but to abet it . ( the audience shouted and cheered and clapped their hands . ) eventually , both tom and jim stop the fight , and tom walks liza home . liza is now publicly stigmatised as a wrong one , a fact she herself admits to tom ( oh , but i ave treated yer bad . i m a regular wrong un , i am ) . despite all her misbehaviour ( i could n't elp it ! [ ... ] i did love i m so ! ) , tom still wants to marry liza , but she tells him that it s too lite now because she thinks she is pregnant . tom says he would n't mind that , but she insists on refusing . meanwhile , at the blakestones ' , jim beats up his wife . other residents hear them and young polly appeals to some for help , but they choose not to interfere in other people s domestic problems ( she ll git over it ; an ' p'raps she deserves it , for all you know ) . when mrs kemp comes home and sees her daughter s injuries , all she does is offer her some alcohol ( whiskey or gin ) . that evening they both get drunk , despite liza s pregnancy . during the next night liza has a miscarriage . mr hodges , who lives upstairs , fetches a doctor from the nearby hospital , who soon says he can do nothing for her . while her daughter is dying , mrs kemp has a long talk with mrs hodges , a midwife and sick - nurse . liza s last visitor is jim , but liza is already in a coma . mrs kemp and mrs hodges are talking about the funeral arrangements when they hear liza A1 polly A2 polly
